# NimbusPi

NimbusPi is a collection of projection mapping, VJ, and lighting design tool built for the Raspberry Pi. 

### Overview
NimbusPi images currently contains 2 separate applications, ShaderMapper and FlowMapper. You can easily switch between these applications, but only 1 may be run at a time. See the feature sets for each below:

##### ShaderMapper (Note: USB Microphone Recomended)
- Multi object quad and grid warping with masking
- Content generated live by sound reactive GLSL Fragement Shaders (limit: simultaneous playback of 2x shaders, applied to up to 4 objects)
- Ability to record Artnet/DMX and playback at a variable rate or driven by audio amplitude.

##### FlowMapper (Note: USB Webcam Required)
- Multi object quad and grid warping, no masking
- Content generated by applying effects to a local webcam stream
- Effects include time delay, brightness and movement thresholds, kaleidoscoping, and color mixing.
- Works very well for live "Light Painting" installations

## Running Locally

The code based is based around Three.js and designed primarily to be run as a local web app. Most features will work on any machine capable of running a simple webserver, php, and chrome. Features related to DMX typically require additional configuration to proxy the OLA port (9090) to your web port.
