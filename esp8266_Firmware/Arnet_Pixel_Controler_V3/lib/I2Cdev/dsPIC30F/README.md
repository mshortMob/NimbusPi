# I2C Device Library for dsPIC30F(under construction)

## I2Cdev
We use XC16's peripheral libraries (_plib_), read timeout is not implemented.

## Devices
Currently only MPU6050 is supported without DMP functions. There's an example MPLABX project showing how to read raw data from the MPU.

Adding more functions and devices should be straighforward after reading the source code.

## Licence
I2Cdev device library code is placed under the MIT license.
